Ford-Fulkerson initiated
iteration 1:
path: a->[12;0]<-b->[7;0]<-d->[10;0]<-f
Path flow is 7

iteration 2:
path: a->[5;0]<-f
Path flow is 5

iteration 3:
path: a->[5;7]<-b->[3;0]<-c->[6;0]<-e->[10;0]<-f
Path flow is 3

iteration 4:
path: a->[3;0]<-c->[5;0]<-d->[3;7]<-f
Path flow is 3

Max Flow = 7 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 18

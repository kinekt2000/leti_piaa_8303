add key: A
trie is empty, root created
create children with character: A

Machinizer initiated
built suffix link for 0 node. 
suffix-link calculator initiated for node: 0
suffix[root] = root
Suffix link leads to 0 node

built suffix link for 1 node. 
suffix-link calculator initiated for node: 1
this is a child of root. suffix = root
Suffix link leads to 0 node

search initiated. Initial state is root
~~~calculate new state
current state has child with 'A' character. Its id is 1
~~~new state is 1

new state is not root, we have to check node and its suffix path
there could be ends of patterns
state 1 is end of pattern. pattern found on position 0
supposed full pattern positions: 0 
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0
~~~calculate new state
There is no child with 'C' character. Set state as suffix link. New state is 0
~~~new state is 0

~~~calculate new state
~~~new state is 0

~~~calculate new state
current state has child with 'A' character. Its id is 1
~~~new state is 1

new state is not root, we have to check node and its suffix path
there could be ends of patterns
state 1 is end of pattern. pattern found on position 3
supposed full pattern positions: 3 0 
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0

There is no child with 'N' character. Set state as suffix link. New state is 0
~~~new state is 0

state 1 is end of pattern. pattern found on position 6
supposed full pattern positions: 6 3 
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0

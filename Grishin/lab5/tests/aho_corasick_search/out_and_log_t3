~~~calculate new state
~~~new state is 0


~~~calculate new state
current state has child with 'T' character. Its id is 1
~~~new state is 1

new state is not root, we have to check node and its suffix path
there could be ends of patterns
state 1 is end of pattern. pattern found on position 1
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0

~~~calculate new state
current state has child with 'A' character. Its id is 2
~~~new state is 2

new state is not root, we have to check node and its suffix path
there could be ends of patterns
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0

~~~calculate new state
current state has child with 'G' character. Its id is 3
~~~new state is 3

new state is not root, we have to check node and its suffix path
there could be ends of patterns
state 3 is end of pattern. pattern found on position 1
go deeper on the suffix link. Now, state to check is 0
